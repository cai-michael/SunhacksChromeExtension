What inspired TubeSCII?

We all wanted to learn JavaScript at some point, and we figured that this hackathon would present the perfect oppurtunity to do so. 
TubeSCII allowed us to figure out we could use Node.js to make a server and how to incorporate html and css files with the said server. 

Basically we decided to make TubeSCII out of desperation to do something at this hackathon.

And so we did.

TubeSCII evolved before our very eyes into a loveable, yet mostly useless, JavaScript project. While it may be useless to the rest of the world to us it 
offered a great learning experience.
